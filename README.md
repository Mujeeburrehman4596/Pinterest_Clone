# Pinterest_Clone
Create a Pinterest clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase your design skills! This project will allow users to create, save, and share visual bookmarks called "pins." Implement features like user registration, boards for organizing pins, a responsive grid layout, and a search functionality for easy navigation.
